# Okame
Okame is a simple and fun mobile application built entirely in Dart and Flutter, without any third-party packages. The app was created as a personal project to explore the capabilities of the Flutter framework and the power of building apps with pure Dart. Okame is an application that helps you calculate your daily returns for your income streams. The aesthetically pleasing and intuitive user interface is made to gamify and encourage the act of saving money via various means of investment (content creation, saving accounts, real estate, stocks, ...). Okame does not share your data with anyone, your data is stored only locally on your device.
